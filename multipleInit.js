The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the `initializeApp()` function is called multiple times with different configurations. This can happen if you have multiple modules or components in your application initializing Firebase independently. The symptom is that even though your Firebase app seems to work initially, it might fail silently or cause unexpected behavior later on.  The error might not be immediately obvious and may manifest as seemingly unrelated issues.

```javascript
//Incorrect usage - multiple initializations
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

const config1 = { ... };
const config2 = { ... }; // Different config

initializeApp(config1);
// ... some code...
getAuth();
initializeApp(config2);
```
