# Firebase: Silent Errors from Multiple `initializeApp()` Calls

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error when using the Firebase JavaScript SDK: calling `initializeApp()` multiple times with different configuration objects. This can lead to silent failures and unpredictable application behavior. 

## Problem
The issue arises when different parts of your application independently initialize Firebase with varying configurations.  While the initial setup might appear successful, subsequent calls can interfere, causing the app to fail silently or exhibit unexpected behavior. The root cause lies in the lack of explicit error handling, making this a challenging bug to diagnose.

## Solution
The core solution involves ensuring that `initializeApp()` is called only once, ideally in a centralized location such as a dedicated Firebase initialization module.  This module will export the initialized app instance which is then imported and used throughout the application.  This centralized approach prevents conflicts and inconsistencies.
